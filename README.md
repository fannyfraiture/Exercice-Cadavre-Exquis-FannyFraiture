### This is a really cool duck, and he will surely help you a lot. 
### I find that it's hard to make this duck talk, he's a little shy. 
### Remember, Dont lose the duck or you wont be getting any help !!!
The duck gives good advices although he can only say one word

But this word could be interpreted in many ways: "KWAAk" is a full dictionary as your imagination is limitless. Don't undersestimate him : he's a psychic.

Indeed i love my little Duck as much as i love my cute cat.
But can this dictionarry could find me a nice advice on how to keep both my duck and my cat in the same house with Harmoney?!
